## Launch A Local Substrate Development Chain ##
>Use the Substrate Node Template to launch a local development chain and use the Front-End Template to make a balance transfer and make an on-chain remark with your GitHub username.

## Run A Private Substrate Network ##
>Use Substrate to run a private local network.

## Play With Westend ##
>Get tokens from the Westend faucet and use the Polkadot-JS Apps UI to make a remark on the Westend chain.

## Back-End Javascript ##
>Use Polkadot-JS to write a command line utility that displays information about the latest block on Kusama, Polkadot or any other Substrate-based chain. Bonus: include an option to search for a block by number (height) and/or hash.

## Front-End Javascript ##
>Use Polkadot-JS or the Front-End Template to write a web page (hosted on GitHub pages or similar) that displays information about the latest block on Kusama, Polkadot or any other Substrate-based chain. Bonus: include a component to search for a block by number (height) and/or hash.

## Run a Kusama or Polkadot node and add it to Telemetry ##
>Download the latest binary release or build Polkadot or Kusama from source, and run your node. Add it to telemetry as per the README instructions, and let us know when your node appears in the telemetry.polkadot.io list!

## Set an identity on Kusama or Polkadot's development version ##
>Substrate-based chains which implement the Identities pallet let users of the chain set some on-chain metadata through which to identify their accounts. Kusama and Polkadot come with identities built in, but on node-template youâ€™d have to manually extend the chain. This challenge takes the easier route: run the --dev version of Kusama or Polkadot, and register an identity on it.

## FRAME Identity: Set an identity on a local --dev chain [I] ##
>Substrate-based chains which implement the Identities pallet let users of the chain set some on-chain metadata through which to identify their accounts. Kusama and Polkadot come with identities built in, but on node-template you have to manually extend the chain. Do it. Add the identity pallet to node template, then register an identity of an account on your local development chain.

## Forkless Upgrades [I] ##
>Perform a forkless runtime upgrade on a local development chain.
